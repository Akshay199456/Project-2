# Shopaholic : A Retail Shopping Site

## Hi everyone! Welcome to our Project 2!!! This project was completed by [SeHee Son](https://git.generalassemb.ly/seheesf88) and [Akshay Mysore](https://git.generalassemb.ly/AkshayMysore).



### Hosted Project Link: [Needs to be linked here]

The website that we came up with is **Shopaholic**. Most retail shopping sites like Amazon, Walmart and Ebay that people visit bombard you with a lot of information which makes the experience to navigate the site poor. People are left confused as to which item to exactly buy, where to buy it and so on. As a result, we wanted to build a site with a design-first focus that made it a good and pleasurable experience for the user. Thus, came up the idea for **Shopaholic**.  


### Technologies used:

The basic technologies used to build the site were HTML, CSS and JS. In addition, we used additional technologies to create a unique experience for the user. We used [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) to create icons that we used in the site, [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) to make DOM manipulation easier, [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to render the visual appearence of the site and make it responsive, [mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) to host the data in the database [Express](https://expressjs.com/) to build the server-side technology and [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to add style for the fonts used.  

### Approach taken:

There was a lot of work that was put in from all the team members to make this product a success. In order to make it possible, we divided our work between each other. While SeHee worked on most of the front-end rendering of the admin and user and writing server side code for the admin, Akshay primarily worked on the server-side technology associated with the users entering the site, the items available on the market and the front-end rendering for the user. This allowed us to complete our MVP much sooner as expected as we were able to complete each of our tasks relatively easily.

### Installation Requirements:

The way the site currently works is that the admin has the ability to create the items and put them on the market. In order to create and admin account, you will need to register an account with the email as **admin@gmail.com**. Once the admin account has been created, you will be able to add as many items on the market as you want. You can then create user accounts by filling it with any information. Once logged in, the user can view all the items on the market, updated his profile info, view his order history and buy an item on the market. 

### UserStories [Needs to be updated for the current projected]:

### Forthcoming features:

While we were able to discover bugs and fix them in our testing of the code, we would still love to hear from you about any other bugs that you might encounter.

With respect to forthcoming features, ooooh, we have a lot of them planned for future updates. 

	1. Recommend items to buy based on items that have been bought by the user.
	2. Convert the admin to seller and create a seller market similar to the items market.
	3. Use Stripe to authenticate payment for purchases made.
	4. Enable a shopping cart to purchase multiple items at once.
	5. Allowing the ability to upload images instead of inserting image url (**multer** seems like a start).
	6. Enable comments and ratings to be added to items in the market.
	7. Generate random images for the carousel that is available once you are logged in.
	8. Provide profile picture option for user and admin. 
	9. Confirm password authentication when updating profile password and creating account.
	10. Create a modal for an about section of the page.
	11. Allow multiple items to be placed on the market for sale.

Please let us know if you want us to add any other features that you would like. We are looking to expand our site in functionality and design so any recommendations will be happily accepted.
